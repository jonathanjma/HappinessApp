# Happiness App
Happiness App is a social journaling app where you can rate your happiness each day and view happiness trends for yourself and your friends. You can also log journal entires for each day. With this data you can reflect on yourself and events happening in your life. The app also destigmatizes talking about emotional health with friends, and encourages reflection and positive change.

## Status
