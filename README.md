# Happiness App

Happiness App is a social journaling web app where you can rate your happiness each day and view
happiness trends for yourself and your friends. You can also log journal entries for each day. With
this data you can reflect on yourself and events happening in your life. The app also destigmatizes
talking about emotional health with friends and encourages reflection and positive change.

Happiness App is being developed using React for the frontend and Flask + SQLAlchemy for the backend.

## Status

Happiness App is currently under development. We have released a minimum viable product for closed beta testing. 
Right now we are working on the full product. 

We have onboarded designers  [Dennis Quizhpi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-quizhpi/), [Joy Alemu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joy-alemu-180488211/), and [Jennifer Ai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferaiii/). They are working on creating the designs for the Happiness App 2.0 update.
This will include a complete redesign of the app, and new features such as commenting on happiness entries, profile picture support, searching and filtering for happiness entries, and completely private journaling using open source end-to-end encryption.
