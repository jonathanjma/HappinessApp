# Happiness App

Happiness App is a social journaling web app where you can rate your happiness each day and view
happiness trends for yourself and your friends. You can also log journal entries for each day. With
this data you can reflect on yourself and events happening in your life. The app also destigmatizes
talking about emotional health with friends and encourages reflection and positive change.

Happiness App is being developed using React for the frontend and Flask + SQLAlchemy for the backend.

## Status
